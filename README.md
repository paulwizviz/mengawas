# `Mengawas`: Demonstrating Solutions for Supply Chain Challenges (Educational Project)

`Mengawas` is an educational project that demonstrates techniques for developing solutions to supply chain challenges. It uses a simulated wine-making process as a case study to illustrate key concepts and development stages.

## Development Lifecycle

`Mengawas` follows a development lifecycle summarized in Figure 1 intended to discover, plan, and manage the implementation of solutions for supply chain challenges. Whilst `mengawas` uses a simulated wine making process to illustrate the process, the development lifecycle is applicable to other supply chain scenarios.
