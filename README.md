# Overview

This is a project to demonstrate a wine making supply chain leveraging on peer-to-peer technologies, such as blockchain, to enable the chain to be efficient.

## Context

The basic steps in the wine-making process is illustrated in Figure 1.

From a supply chain perspective, the wine-making process consists of key stages: harvesting, processing, bottling, distribution, and selling (see Figure 2). We have grouped juice extraction, fermentation, pressing, filtration, and aging into a single stage called `processing`, as these steps are rarely performed independently. Transportation segments connect the supply chain stages, facilitating the movement of both intermediate and final products. We refer to this part of the supply chain as the production chain.

Running parallel to the production chain is the regulatory chain, which consists of participants responsible for ensuring that the production chain complies with regulations and quality standards.

The third component of the supply chain is the support chain, responsible for supplying equipment, such as casks and bottles, or services that enable the production chain to produce wine.
