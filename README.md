# Mengawas: Optimizing the Wine-Making Supply Chain

Mengawas is a project demonstrating the development of solutions to support and optimize the wine-making supply chain.

## Project Background

The wine production process, as summarized in Figure 1, highlights the critical importance of lifecycle integrity for final product quality.

Key data points for ensuring product quality are detailed [here](./docs/product_life.md).

While some wineries manage the entire process from harvest to direct sales (as seen in Figure 1), the wine industry often involves a complex supply chain with multiple participants. A detailed analysis of the supply chain is [here](./docs/supply_chain.md).

## Project Goals and Challenges

Wine supply chain participants face several significant challenges, including:

* **Climate Change:**  Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns lead to fluctuating yields and impact grape quality.
* **Regulatory Compliance:**  Meeting evolving regulatory demands adds complexity and cost to the production process.
* **Information Silos:**  The decentralized nature of the industry often results in fragmented information sharing, hindering collaboration and traceability.

The goal of Mengawas is to develop a solution that addresses these challenges, improving efficiency and transparency across the wine-making supply chain.

## Project Scope and Deliverables

Mengawas aims to deliver a track and trace solution leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) across the supply chain. The proposed architecture for this solution is depicted in Figure 3.
