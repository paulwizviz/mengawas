# `Mengawas`: Demonstrating Solutions for Supply Chain Challenges (Educational Project)

`Mengawas` is an educational project that demonstrates techniques for developing solutions to supply chain challenges. It uses a simulated wine-making process as a case study to illustrate key concepts and development stages.

## Development Lifecycle

`Mengawas` follows a simplified development lifecycle summarized in Figure 1 as the process of discovering, planning, and managing the implementation of solutions for supply chain challenges.

Detailed discussions and illustrations of the `mengawas` development lifecycle, using a simulated wine-making process, are covered in these documents:

* [Defining the Problem](./docs/solution.md#what-problem-are-we-solving)
* [Analyzing the Product Lifecycle](./docs/product_life.md)
* [Analyzing the Supply Chain](./docs/supply_chain.md)
* [Exploring Solution Architectures](./docs/solution.md#whiteboard-architecture---options)
* [Creating Product Backlogs](./docs/solution.md#product-backlogs)

> **NOTE:**
> 1.  The development lifecycle is applicable to other supply chain scenarios.
> 2.  The intermediate steps, such as translating a high-level architecture to a detailed product backlog, are not explicitly shown in this project.
> 3.  The findings presented in the product lifecycle analysis, supply chain analysis, and solution architecture documents are simplified for educational purposes. In a real-world project, these documents would be constantly evolving and synchronized with user stories.
