# Mengawas: Optimizing the Wine-Making Supply Chain (Educational Project)

`Mengawas` is an educational project demonstrating the process of developing solutions for supply chain challenges. It uses a simulated wine-making process as a case study to illustrate key concepts and development stages.

## Development Lifecycle

`Mengawas` follows a simplified development lifecycle, as summarized in Figure 1, to demonstrate the process of moving from problem definition to a potential solution.

The results of each stage in the `mengawas` development lifecycle are presented in the following documents:

* [What problems are we solving?](./docs/solution.md#what-problem-are-we-solving)
* [Product lifecycle analysis](./docs/product_life.md) (Wine-making focus)
* [Supply chain analysis](./docs/supply_chain.md)
* [Whiteboard Architecture - Options](./docs/solution.md#whiteboard-architecture---options)
* [Product Backlogs](./docs/solution.md#product-backlogs)

> **NOTE:**
> 1.  This project uses a simplified development lifecycle and wine-making case study for educational purposes.  While the core steps are applicable to other supply chain scenarios, the level of detail is reduced for clarity.
> 2.  The intermediate steps, such as translating a high-level architecture to a detailed product backlog, are not explicitly shown in this project.
> 3.  The findings presented in product lifecycle analysis, supply chain analysis and solution architect are simplified but in real work project these documente would be constantly evolving and synchronised to user stories.
