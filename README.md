# `Mengawas`: Demonstrating Solutions for Supply Chain Challenges (Educational Project)

A supply chain is a network of organisations, people, activities, data, and resources involved in moving a product or service from origin to consumer. Key participants typically include suppliers, processors, warehouses, distributors, merchants, and consumers.

The pain points experienced in a supply chain differ significantly from those in a typical business-to-consumer scenario. Building a business-to-consumer solution often focuses on the needs of a representative end-user. In contrast, a supply chain involves multiple independent participants who must coordinate their activities, often peer-to-peer. The challenge lies in addressing the unique pain points of *each* participant.

`Mengawas` is an educational project demonstrating techniques for developing solutions to supply chain challenges. It uses a simulated wine-making process as a case study to illustrate key concepts and development stages. The following sections detail the development lifecycle used in `Mengawas` to illustrate these techniques.

## Development Lifecycle

`Mengawas` follows a simplified development lifecycle (Figure 1) to illustrate the process of discovering, planning, and managing solutions for supply chain challenges. While `Mengawas` uses a simulated wine-making process, this lifecycle is applicable to other supply chain scenarios.
