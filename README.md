# Mengawas: Optimizing the Wine-Making Supply Chain (Educational Project)

`Mengawas` is an educational project demonstrating the process of developing solutions for supply chain challenges. It uses a simulated wine-making process as a case study to illustrate key concepts and development stages.

## Wine-Making Supply Chain Challenges

Real-world wine supply chain participants face several significant challenges, including:

* **Climate Change:** Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns lead to fluctuating yields and impact grape quality.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Meeting evolving regulatory demands adds complexity and cost.
* **Information Silos:** The decentralized nature of the industry often results in fragmented information sharing, hindering collaboration and traceability.

`Mengawas` explores how a simulated solution can be developed to address these challenges, focusing on improving efficiency and transparency within the wine-making supply chain.

## Development Lifecycle

`Mengawas` follows a simplified development lifecycle, as summarized in Figure 1, to demonstrate the process of moving from problem definition to a potential solution.

The results of each stage in the `mengawas` development lifecycle are presented in the following documents:

* [Product Lifecycle Analysis](./docs/product_life.md) (Wine-making focus)
* [Supply Chain Analysis](./docs/supply_chain.md)
* [Solution Architecture](./docs/solution.md)

> **NOTE:**
> 1.  This project uses a simplified development lifecycle and wine-making case study for educational purposes.  While the core steps are applicable to other supply chain scenarios, the level of detail is reduced for clarity.
> 2.  The intermediate steps, such as translating a high-level architecture to a detailed product backlog, are not explicitly shown in this project.
> 3.  The findings presented in product lifecycle analysis, supply chain analysis and solution architect are simplified but in real work project these documente would be constantly evolving and synchronised to user stories.
