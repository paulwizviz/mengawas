# Overview

While blockchain holds promise for industry transformation, it's vital to use it in ways that address, rather than worsen, industry challenges. In this project, we'll employ an illustrative approach to examine the challenges of a fictional wine-making supply chain and then systematically introduce blockchain to address those industry challenges.

## Project Context

The basic steps in the wine-making process are summarized in Figure 1.

When viewed from a supply chain perspective, the wine-making process is encapsulated in these key stages: harvesting, processing, bottling, distribution, and selling (see Figure 2). We have bundled juice extraction, fermentation, pressing, filtration, and aging into a single stage known collectively as `processing`. The steps in the processing stage are seldom independently executed. Between the supply chain stages are transportation segments that serve as bridges, facilitating the movement of intermediate and final products.

Simultaneously, a regulatory chain runs parallel to the physical supply chain. Its primary role is to ensure compliance with regulations, particularly in areas such as health and safety, and product grading, at every stage of the physical chain.
