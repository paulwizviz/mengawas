# Overview

This is a **educational** project to demonstrates the use of blockchain-based technologies networked in a way to support wine-making supply chain.

This project is presented from the perspective of a fictional company with a mission to help businesses form networks by leveraging on blockchain technologies. When you encounter the pronouns `we`, `our` and `us`, they refer to the fictional company. This fictional company is **not** a participants in the supply chain only in the role of technology provider. 

Also for the purpose of this project, fictional countries (`Atlantis`, `Wakanda` and more) and companies and personas to represent participants in the supply chain.

## Context

The basic steps involved in wine making process is summarised in Figure 1.

**Figure 1: Basic Wine Making Steps (see [Image source](https://finding.wine/blogs/blog-posts/basic-steps-of-the-winemaking-process))**

From a supply chain perspective (see Figure 2), the stages in the chain are harvesting, processing (i.e. extract juice, fermentation, pressure, filtration and aging), bottling, distribution and selling. In between these stages are transportations to move intermediate and final products between these stages.

<u>What problems are we trying to solve?</u>

`Alantis` is a famous wine making country. However, the country's wine making supply chain is dominated by a single company, name `Acme`, which control the processing, bottling and distribution of wines. `Acme` also owns a vineyard and its chain of pubs. `Wakanda` a major importer of `Atlantis` wines is also dissatisfied with the dorminance of `Acme`. Together with the supply chain participants in `Atlantis`, `Wakanda` lodge a complain to the `World Trading Body`.

The `World Trading Body` came to a judgement and ruled that `Alantis` reform the wine supply chain make it more competitive. Allowing for more participants to participate in the supply chain.

Detail analysis of the challenge for `Atlantis` to reform the supply chain is documented [here](./docs/challenge.md)

<u>A proposed solution</u>

`Atlantis` government has engaged us to find a solution and we proposed one based on blockchain which we discussed in a report found [here](./docs/solution.md). The rationale for using a blockchain based solution are as follows:

* Enable participants in the supply chain to transact with each other on a peer-to-peer basis.
* Providing a network effect for participants to achieve economies of scale whilst remaining independent entities to avoid anti-competitive practices.
* Giving regulated bodies bette oversight of the supply chain and to act quickly in the event of bad practice.
* Enabling the supply chain to be efficient.

<u>The Implementations</u>

The implemention of our solution is dicussed [here](./docs/implementation.md)
