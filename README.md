# Overview

This is a **educational** project to demonstrates a blockchain-based technologies networked in a way to support a hypothethical wine-making supply chain.

## Context

The basic steps involved in wine making process is summarised in Figure 1.

**Figure 1: Basic Wine Making Steps (see [Image source](https://finding.wine/blogs/blog-posts/basic-steps-of-the-winemaking-process))**

From a supply chain perspective, the stages characterising the chain are harvesting, processing (see Figure 1 for details), bottling, distribution and selling (see Figure 2). In between these stages are transportations to move intermediate and final products between these stages.

## Who are we and what do we do?

Through out this project, the use of the pronouns `we`, `our` and `us` refer to a fictional company in the role of a business network operator. 

Our mission is to provide the necessary blockchain technological stack to participants in the wine making supply chain to form a peer-to-peer network.

Our role is not to engage the business activity in the supply chain.

## What problems are we trying to solve?

The country of `Alantis`, famous for making wine, is dominated by a single company, name `Acme`, who control the processing, bottling and distribution of wines. `Acme` also owns a vineyard and its chain of pubs.

There are also small vineyards but they find it hard to get their grapes produced and sold directly to consumers and the price of their products are dictated by `Acme`.

`Atlantis` wine sellers and importers of wines from the country also find themselves in an unsatisfactory situation where they can only source from `Acme`.

The monopolies commissions `Atlantis` has ruled that `Acme's` monopoly in the country's wine supply chain is unhealthy. The government of `Atlantis` has decided to act on the ruling by opening up the supply chain to competition. There is no plan to break up `Acme` but to bring in more participants to the supply chain.

`Atlantis` government's goal is for small Vineyards to be able to sell directly to consumers or export directly. Likewise for any company to be independent distiller (wine processing), bottling, distribution or selling or combination to compete with `Acme`. The government is also mindful of the need to regulate the industry to ensure that the necessary standards is met.

## What is our solution?

We have proposed to the `Atlantis` government a blockchain-based solution the details of our implementation are discussed in separate sections (see `Project Details`).

In summary, the rationale for using a blockchain based solution are as follows:

* Enable participants in the supply chain to transact with each other on a peer-to-peer basis.
* Providing a network effect for participants to achieve economies of scale whilst remaining independent entities to avoid anti-competitive practices.
* Giving regulated bodies bette oversight of the supply chain and to act quickly in the event of bad practice.
* Enabling the supply chain to be efficient.
