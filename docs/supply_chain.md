# Supply Chain

`Mengawas` models the wine making supply chain, as illustrated in Figure 2.

In the figure, `mengawas` has identified three sub-chains:

* [Product chain](#product-chain)
* [Support chain](#support-chain)
* [Regulatory chain](#regulatory-chain)

## Product Chain 

The product chain consists of entities directly responsible for the production of wine - i.e. `harvesting`, `processing`, `warehousing`, and `selling`. Note, for this project, `processing` includes the following activities:

* Extract Juice
* Fermentation
* Pressure
* Filtration
* Aging
* Bottling

## Support Chain

The support chain consists of participants the are not directly involved in the production of wines -- e.g. transporting products between production participants.

## Regulatory Chain

The regulatory chain consists of participants that are independent of the product chain overseeing the safety and quality of the product.
