# Vineyards

The role of vineyards is to produce grapes of a quality that can be sold to processors.

`Mengawas` is delivering a solution for two participants:

* **Vineyard One**
* **Vineyard Two**

Vineyard One is contracted to deliver grapes to Processor One, which only accepts grapes for fine-quality wines. Any lesser-quality grapes are delivered to Processor Two.

Vineyard Two is contracted to deliver grapes exclusively to Processor Two, which produces only medium-quality wine.

## Pain Points

* Vineyard One lacks digital infrastructure to monitor vine-growing conditions. Data is collected manually on an ad hoc basis, and vineyard management relies on practices passed down through generations.
* Vineyard Two has some digitalisation expertise, allowing real-time capture of soil and weather data.
* Both vineyards lack an efficient way to predict potential yield and optimise their return on investment.

## Proposed Solution

* Vineyard One will integrate IoT sensors to capture soil and weather data.
* An AI-based data analytics solution will be implemented to help both Vineyard One and Vineyard Two predict yield.

## Initial Research Data

An initial study was conducted to determine the relationship between grape-growing conditions and grape yield quality.

### Parameters for Determining Grape Quality

#### 1. Grapes for Fine-Quality Wines

| Measure | Unit | Example Values |
|---|---|---|
| Sugar Content (\u00b0Brix) | \u00b0Bx | 22–26 \u00b0Bx |
| pH Level| - | 3.2–3.5 |
| Titratable Acidity (TA) | g/L tartaric acid | 5.5–8.0 g/L |
| Phenolics (Tannins, Anthocyanins) | mg/L | Anthocyanins: 300–800 mg/L (reds)<br> Tannins: 500–2500 mg/L (reds) |
| Yeast-Assimilable Nitrogen (YAN) | mg/L | 140–250 mg/L |
| Berry Weight | g/berry | 1.2–2.0 g (reds), 1.5–3.5 g (whites) |
| Berry Skin Thickness | mm | 0.15–0.25 mm (reds have thicker skins) |
| Firmness (Pressure Resistance) | Newtons (N) | 0.3–0.5 N (measured with a texture analyser) |

#### 2. Grapes for Medium-Quality Wines

| Measure | Unit | Example Values |
|---|---|---|
| Sugar Content (\u00b0Brix) | \u00b0Bx | 18–22 \u00b0Bx |
| pH Level| - | 3.3–3.7 |
| Titratable Acidity (TA) | g/L tartaric acid | 4.5–6.5 g/L |
| Phenolics (Tannins, Anthocyanins) | mg/L | Anthocyanins: 150–400 mg/L (reds)<br> Tannins: 300–1500 mg/L |
| Yeast-Assimilable Nitrogen (YAN) | mg/L | 100–200 mg/L |
| Berry Weight | g/berry | 1.2–2.0 g (reds), 1.5–3.0 g |
| Berry Skin Thickness | mm | 0.10–0.20 mm |
| Firmness (Pressure Resistance) | Newtons (N) | 0.2–0.4 N |

### Factors Influencing Grape Quality

#### 1. Climatic Factors (Temperature, Rainfall, Sunlight)

| Factor | Unit | Fine Wine Grapes | Medium-Quality Grapes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Growing Season Temperature (GST) | \u00b0C | 15–22°C | 18–25°C |
| Diurnal Temperature Variation | \u00b0C (Day-Night Difference) | 10–15°C | 5–12°C |
| Annual Rainfall | mm/year | 400–800 mm | 600–1000 mm |
| Sunlight Hours (Growing Season) | Hours | 1200–1800 hrs | 1000–1600 hrs |

#### 2. Soil Composition & Nutrients

| Factor | Unit | Fine Wine Grapes | Medium-Quality Grapes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soil pH | - | 5.5–7.0 | 5.8–7.5 |
| Organic Matter | % | 1–3% | 2–4% |
| Drainage (Permeability Rate) | mm/hour | 5–20 mm/hr | 10–30 mm/hr |
| Nitrogen (N) | mg/kg | 20–50 mg/kg | 30–80 mg/kg |
| Potassium (K) | mg/kg | 100–250 mg/kg | 150–300 mg/kg |
| Calcium (Ca) | mg/kg | 500–1000 mg/kg | 800–1500 mg/kg |

### Key Takeaways

* Fine wine grapes need moderate climates, well-drained soils, controlled water stress, and low yields.
* Medium-quality grapes require slightly higher temperatures, more water, and moderate yields.
