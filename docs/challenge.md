# Tides of Complexity: Examining the Supply Chain Challenges in Atlantis

In this section we discuss `Atlantis` wine supply chain AS-IS.

## Participants and roles

`Atlantis` exports to more than 10 countries. One country `Wakanda` imports 45% of `Atlantis` wine. We have identified `Wakanda` for a case study involving a participants in a different legal jurisdiction. 

There is a dominant participants in the supply chain: `Alpha`. The company owns vineyards, processing and bottling facilities, distribution warehouse and a chain of pubs. It also owns has a digitalized system that is closely integrated into the regulatory chain. It uses its own digitalized system to manage the supply chain of its fully own subsidaries and also to manage third parties suppliers primarily vineyards.

There are 10 major vineyards and 500 minor vineyards. 

The major vineyards have capacity to grow different types of grapes to produce different types of wines and they have the various capacities to process, bottle and distribute their own products. These vineyards have varying degrees of digitalizations. Some have the ability to integrate with a few regulatory bodies. Others rely on paper work to comply with regulation and track sales of their products. We have identified the following major vineyards as case study:

* `Victor One`.
* `Victor Two`.

The minor vineyards tends to grow one or two types of grapes, and have no capacity to produce wines, except in very small quantities. They tend to supply grapes to third party producers and distributors. The majority have only very limited digital systems, often in the form of a Personal Computer with Excel spreadsheet. They tend to rely on paper-based system to transact with regulatory bodies and record their deliveries to their buyers. We have identified the following as representative of the minor vineyards for case studies:

* `Bravo One`.
* `Bravo Two`.

There are a number of regulatory participants responsible for overseeing the wine supply chain. The principal participants identified in this report but not exclusively are:

* `Atlantis Health Protection Agency (AHPA)`
* `Atlantis Fine Wines Merchant Association (AFWMA)`
* `Atlantis Alcholic Grading Institute (AAGI)`
* `Wakanda Import Supervisory Agency (WISA)`

## Analysis of Wine Export and Import

`Atlantis` as a member of the `World Trade Body` have a basine line preferrential treatmnent when exporting all goods to all member states. In the case of wine, `Atlantis` wine producers needs to demonstrate their wine has met minimial standards to qualify for import to member countries without tariff. However, member countries may impose additional condition, such as health related ones, for imports to be approved.

In the specific case of `Atlantis` and `Wakanda`, there two countries do not operate as a common market so each country maintain separate health regulations. There is no immediate prospect of the two countries forming a common market. 

In addition to trade regulations, wines are graded differently between `Atlantis` and `Wakanda` differently, and grading is done by their respective wine merchants. When `Atlantis` exports wine to `Wakanda`, its wine merchant must met the regulation of `Wakanda` for sale there and/or `Atlantis` regulation if the wine is also sold in country.

## Analysis of Alpha Operations

`Alpha` is a dominant wine maker. It's operations covers all stages of the supply chain. It also buys grapes from third parties vineyard. However, it only exclusively distribute and sell wines through its own distribution channel, including exports to `Wakanda`. Through this dominance, `Alpha` is able to dictate the pricing of grapes and the kind of wines it can sell. 

In addition to wine making operations, it also has a cloud based supply chain management system that it uses to manage its own supply chain but it also rent out the system, in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) to third parties. Its supply chain management system is also closely integrated with the regulatory bodies mentioned in this report. The principal complain about the supply chain system is the features of the system tends to favour `Alpha` own operations and is slow to roll out features that favour third parties. The pricing of `Alpha's` system is also not transparent.

`Wakanda` and third parties users of `Alpha` supply chain management system has complained to the `World Trade Body` that the close integration between `Atlantis` regulators' system and `Alpha` constitute unfair competition.

## Analysis of Major Vineyard Operations

Major vineyards generally have the capcity to perform activities across the some or all of supply chain stages but many lack the scale of `Alpha`. We examine the operations of `Alpha One` and `Alpha Two`.

`Alpha One` owns vineyards, process, bottle and distribute their own wine in `Atlantis` but rely on distributors in `Wakanda`. They do not sell wine to consumers only through to independent tavern in `Atlantis`. They also sell wines to `Alpha` who distribute and sell for them. They their own cloud base supply chain tracking system so they can track their wine up to their distribution system. Their system are also integrated with `Alpha's` system. 

`Alpha Two` owns one vineyards. They produce but do not bottle nor distribute and sell their own wine. They expect their processed wine to `Wakanda` bottlers, distributors and sellers. They do not sell their wines directly in `Atlantis`. Their wines are imported from `Wakanda`. They would like to distribute and sell their wines directly in `Atlantis`. They use a mix of paper-based and PC base system to track their supply chain. 

## Analysis of Minor Vineyard Operations

Minor vineyard, only mostly grow grapes and they do not perform activities down the chain. They mainly sell their grapes to `Alpha` and/or sell their own wine in small quantities within their region. These vineyards are not digitalized and relies on paper-based system to track their products.

`Bravo One` sells all their grapes to `Alpha` but they would like to sell it to other participants down the chain. As much of their supply chain tracking system is primarily paper-base system it is not economical for them to pivot from `Alpha`.

`Bravo Two` sells their grapes to `Alpha` but they also process, bottle, distribute and sell their own wine from their own vineyard. Their tracking system is also primarily paper-based system so they have difficult expanding their business to sell their wine directly. 

## Analysis of Regulators

The main regulator `AHPA` is currently mandated by `Atlantis` government to do spot checks on the entire supply chain a quarterly basis. However, due to incidents of wine poisoning, `Atlantis` has mandated more frequent checks, potentially on a monthly if not weekly basis.

`AFWMA` is focus on grading fine and expensive wines. They require processors to provide in person inspection every quarter but would like it to do more. They also perform inspections one the wines are bottled but the process is expensive. However, the customers of these high grade wines would like more real time inspection.

`AAGI` focus is on consumer grade wine. They do not require intrusive inspection as `AFWMA` but they are mandated by sellers to disambiguate wines from `Atlantis` and imported ones. They are also mandated to track sales volumes but track pricing to ensure fair competitive pricing. 

`WISA` is a regulatory agency to ensure that wines imported to `Wakanda` meets trading standards so they can apply appropriate tariffs. They have and informal arrangement with `AFWA` and `AAGI` to recognise its certification to proof that the origin is from `Atlantis`. However, `Wakanda` is pressing for the provenance of imported wines to be traceable along all stages in the supply chain; all the way back to vineyard.
