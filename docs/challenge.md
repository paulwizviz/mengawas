# Tides of Complexity: Examining the Supply Chain Challenges in Atlantis

This report examines the current state of `Atlantis` wine-making supply chain.

## Participants in the Supply Chain

`Atlantis` exports to more than 10 countries. However, for our analysis, we'll focus on `Wakanda`, which imports 45% of `Atlantis'` wine.

There are many participants in the supply chain spread across the two countries. One participant, `Alpha`, controls entities across the entire supply chain and is the dominant player in the chain. Its closest peer is `Bravo`. The other participants are primarily vineyards, serving as the main sources of ingredients for other intermediaries in the supply chain. Finally, we have consumers of the wines.

A snapshot of the participants that we have identified for our analysis is presented in Table 1.

| Participants | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Alpha` | Vineyard, distiller, bottler, warehousing, and wine merchant |
| `Bravo` | Distiller, bottler, warehousing, and wine marchant |
| `Delta` | Distiller and bottler |
| `Foxtrot` | Bottler|
| `Mike` | Wine merchants |
| `Whisky one` | Warehousing |
| `Whiskey two` | Warehousing and wine merchant |
| `Victor one` | Vineyard, distiller, and bottler |
| `Victor two` | Vineyard |
| `C1` | Connoisseur of high end and expensive wines |
| `C2` | Consumers of expensive wines for their tastes and social status such wines confer |
| `C3` | Regular consumers |

In parallel to the supply chain are regulators, with the principal ones listed in Table 2.

| Participants | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Atlantis Health Protection Agency (AHPA)` | Ensure that products sold meet health standard, wine is only one aspect |
| `Atlantis Fine Wines Merchant Association (AFWMA)` | Grades wines for C1 consumers |
| `Atlantis Alcholic Grading Institute (AAGI)` | Grades wines for C2 and C3 consumers and price control |
| `Wakanda Import Supervisory Agency (WISA)` | Ensure compliance to international trading rules |
| `Wakanda Health Agency (WHA)` | Similar role as AHPA |

## Analysis of Wine Export and Import Challenges

`Atlantis`, as a member of the `World Trade Body`, has a baseline preferential treatment when exporting all goods to all member states. In the case of wine, `Atlantis'` wine producers need to demonstrate that their wine has met minimal standards to qualify for import to member countries without tariffs. However, member countries may impose additional conditions, such as health-related ones, for imports to be approved.

In the specific case of `Atlantis` and `Wakanda`, these two countries do not operate as a common market, so each country maintains separate health regulations. There is no immediate prospect of the two countries forming a common market.

In addition to trade regulations, wines are graded differently between `Atlantis` and `Wakanda`, and grading is done by their respective wine merchants. When `Atlantis` exports wine to `Wakanda`, its wine merchants must meet the `Wakanda's` regulation for sale there and/or Atlantis' regulations if the wine is also sold in the country.

## Analysis of Alpha Operations

`Alpha` dominates the wine industry, controlling all supply chain stages. It produces and exclusively distributes wines made from grapes sourced from its own vineyard and third-party vineyards. It also sells end products produced by third-parties through its distribution channels such as its supermarket and wine merchant. This dominance enables Alpha to control grape pricing, wine variety, and distribution costs.

Besides wine production, `Alpha` offers a cloud-based supply chain management system, provided as Software as a Service (SaaS) to third parties. Integrated with regulatory bodies, other participants in the supply chain utilize the system, even if they don't transact with Alpha. However, concerns have been raised about favoritism in feature rollout and lack of pricing transparency. 

`Alpha` sells wines to be consumed by `C2` and `C3`. The SaaS offering have tended to favour features that meet deliveries to these consumers, often neglacting features to manage high-end wines for `C1`.

`Wakanda` and third-party users have lodged complaints with the `World Trade Body`, alleging unfair competition due to close integration between Atlantis regulators' system and Alpha. The allegation is that `Alpha` influences regulators' choice of system, making it harder for new entrants to provide a supply chain management system, especially from `Wakanda`.

## Analysis of Non-Alpha Participants

`Bravo` is `Alpha's` closest competitor. It sources grapes from third-party vineyards, produces, and distributes wines under its own label. While it also produces wines for third parties like `Victor two`, it lacks the capacity to distribute these wines through its own channels. Instead, third-party wines are distributed by non-`Bravo` owned wine merchants such as `Mike`.

`Bravo` has its own supply chain management system, exclusively for in-house products, not available to third parties. Information for third-party products produced by `Bravo` is available at the point of source (i.e., the grape's provenance) and at the point of delivery.

Wines produced for high-end consumers, like those from `Victor one`, are made in limited quantities. Investment wines are stored in casks and sold directly to `C1` investors. These casks are securely held by Whiskey one, a specialist in such products. Some wines may be sold through wine merchants, distributed by specialized sellers like `Whiskey two`, who also warehouse casks for investment. The provenance of these wines is crucial to C1 consumers.

`Victor one` supplies grapes to `Alpha`, `Bravo`, and independent producers like `Delta`. Their challenge lies in integrating their supply chain management system with partners, which has not yet occurred. Product information, including high-value items, is mainly managed through paper-based systems and relies heavily on trust among partners.

`Victor two` represents the majority of independent vineyards supplying wines to other producers. They rely on `Alpha` and `Bravo` for income and produce their own labeled wines through third parties like `Bravo`, `Delta`, and `Foxtrot`, selling through independent merchants like `Mike`. Sales volumes are typically small, and regulatory approval costs, even for basic standards like those from AHPA, can be high. Diversification is costly with uncertain economic returns, and limited resources prevent significant investment in IT systems for self-sufficiency.

Without a low-cost integration system for vineyards like `Victor two` in `Atlantis` to connect with regulatory bodies, it's challenging for them to access markets in parts of `Atlantis` that it has to cater to, or exports to `Wakanda`.

## Conclusion

The principal conclusions from the analysis of the challenges are:

* `Alpha's` dominance hinders third-party wine producers from selling competitive products.
* `Alpha's` domainance in supply chain management system is a hinerence to others IT suppliers.
* Concerns arise over favoritism due to `Alpha's` close relationship and highly integrated supply chain management with regulators.
* Some segments of the wine sector, such as high-value ones, lack IT support, despite consumer demand for product provenance.
* Small vineyards lack resources to invest in even basic IT systems to exploit the opportunities blocked by `Alpha`.
