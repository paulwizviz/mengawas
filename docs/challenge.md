# Tides of Complexity: Examining the Supply Chain Challenges in Atlantis

In this section we discuss the current state of `Atlantis` wine supply chain.

## Participants

`Atlantis` exports to more than 10 countries. One country `Wakanda` imports 45% of `Atlantis` wine. We have identified `Wakanda` for a case study involving a participants in a different legal jurisdiction. 

In `Alantis`, there is a dominant vineyard known as `Alpha`. There are also other vineyards. For our analysis we have identified the following vineyard:

* `Victor one`.
* `Victor two`.
* `Victor three`.

In addition to vineyards, `Atlantis` also hosts supply chain intermediaries responsible for the processing, bottling, distribution, and the selling stages. For the purpose of our analysis, we have identified the following as case studies.

| Participants | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Delta one` | Distiller (processing stage) |
| `Delta two` | Distiller |
| `Delta three` | Distiller |
|  `Bravo one` | Bottler |
| `Bravo two` | Bottler |
| `Wilco one` | Warehousing (distribution stage) |
| `Wilco two` | Warehousing (distribution stage) |
| `Wilco three` | Warehousing (distribution stage) |
| `Mike one` | Wine merchant (selling stage) |
| `Mike two` | Wine merchant (selling stage) |

There are a number of regulatory participants responsible for overseeing the wine supply chain. The principal participants identified in this report are:

* `Atlantis Health Protection Agency (AHPA)`
* `Atlantis Fine Wines Merchant Association (AFWMA)`
* `Atlantis Alcholic Grading Institute (AAGI)`
* `Wakanda Import Supervisory Agency (WISA)`

Finally, we include in our studies, consumers of wines. In our case studies, we group these consumers by the types of wines they purchase and how they treat their wines. Our groups are:

* `C1` - these are connoisseur of high end and expensive wines.
* `C2` - these are consumers of expensive wines for their tastes and social status such wines confer.
* `C3` - these are regular consumers.

## Analysis of Wine Export and Import

`Atlantis` as a member of the `World Trade Body` have a basine line preferrential treatmnent when exporting all goods to all member states. In the case of wine, `Atlantis` wine producers needs to demonstrate their wine has met minimial standards to qualify for import to member countries without tariff. However, member countries may impose additional condition, such as health related ones, for imports to be approved.

In the specific case of `Atlantis` and `Wakanda`, there two countries do not operate as a common market so each country maintain separate health regulations. There is no immediate prospect of the two countries forming a common market. 

In addition to trade regulations, wines are graded differently between `Atlantis` and `Wakanda` differently, and grading is done by their respective wine merchants. When `Atlantis` exports wine to `Wakanda`, its wine merchant must met the regulation of `Wakanda` for sale there and/or `Atlantis` regulation if the wine is also sold in country.

## Analysis of Alpha Operations

`Alpha` is a dominant wine maker. It's operations covers all stages of the supply chain. It also buys grapes from third parties vineyard. However, it only exclusively distribute and sell wines through its own distribution channel, including exports to `Wakanda`. Through this dominance, `Alpha` is able to dictate the pricing of grapes and the kind of wines it can sell. 

In addition to wine making operations, it also has a cloud based supply chain management system that it uses to manage its own supply chain but it also rent out the system, in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) to third parties. Its supply chain management system is also closely integrated with the regulatory bodies mentioned in this report. The principal complain about the supply chain system is the features of the system tends to favour `Alpha` own operations and is slow to roll out features that favour third parties. The pricing of `Alpha's` system is also not transparent.

`Wakanda` and third parties users of `Alpha` supply chain management system has complained to the `World Trade Body` that the close integration between `Atlantis` regulators' system and `Alpha` constitute unfair competition.

## Analysis of Regulators

The main regulator `AHPA` is currently mandated by `Atlantis` government to do spot checks on the entire supply chain a quarterly basis. However, due to incidents of wine poisoning, `Atlantis` has mandated more frequent checks, potentially on a monthly if not weekly basis.

`AFWMA` is focus on grading fine and expensive wines. They require processors to provide in person inspection every quarter but would like it to do more. They also perform inspections one the wines are bottled but the process is expensive. However, the customers of these high grade wines would like more real time inspection.

`AAGI` focus is on consumer grade wine. They do not require intrusive inspection as `AFWMA` but they are mandated by sellers to disambiguate wines from `Atlantis` and imported ones. They are also mandated to track sales volumes but track pricing to ensure fair competitive pricing. 

`WISA` is a regulatory agency to ensure that wines imported to `Wakanda` meets trading standards so they can apply appropriate tariffs. They have and informal arrangement with `AFWA` and `AAGI` to recognise its certification to proof that the origin is from `Atlantis`. However, `Wakanda` is pressing for the provenance of imported wines to be traceable along all stages in the supply chain; all the way back to vineyard.
