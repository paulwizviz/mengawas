# Tides of Complexity: Examining the Supply Chain Challenges in Atlantis

In this section we discuss `Atlantis` wine supply chain AS-IS.

## Participants and roles

There is a dominant participants in the supply chain: `Acme`. The company owns vineyards, processing and bottling facilities, distribution warehouse and a chain of pubs. It also owns has a digitalized system that is closely integrated into the regulatory chain. It uses its own digitalized system to manage the supply chain of its fully own subsidaries and also to manage third parties suppliers primarily vineyards.

There are 10 major vineyards and 500 minor vineyards. 

The major vineyards have capacity to grow different types of grapes to produce different types of wines and they have the various capacities to process, bottle and distribute their own products. These vineyards have varying degrees of digitalizations. Some have the ability to integrate with a few regulatory bodies. Others rely on paper work to comply with regulation and track sales of their products. We have identified the following major vineyards as case study:

* `Spartar regional vineyard`.
* `Spritzers vineyard`.

The minor vineyards tends to grow one or two types of grapes, and have no capacity to produce wines, except in very small quantities. They tend to supply grapes to third party producers and distributors. The majority have only very limited digital systems, often in the form of a Personal Computer with Excel spreadsheet. They tend to rely on paper-based system to transact with regulatory bodies and record their deliveries to their buyers. We have identified the following as representative of the minor vineyards for case studies:

* `Leon Family Farm and Vineyard`.
* `Theo Vineyard`.

There are a number of regulatory participants responsible for overseeing the wine supply chain. The principal participants identified in this report but not exclusively are:

* `Atlantis Health Protection Agency (AHPA)`
* `Atlantis Fine Wines Merchant Association (AFWMA)`
* `Atlantis Alcholic Grading Institute (AAGI)`
* `Wakanda Import Supervisory Agency (WISA)`
