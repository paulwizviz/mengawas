# Merchant

The merchant is responsible for selling wines to consumers.

For `mengawas` there is only participant in the supply chain.

## Pain Points

* Merchant must ensure that fine wine is kept in proper environmental condition.
* The merchant must make information about fine wine per bottle to consumers.
