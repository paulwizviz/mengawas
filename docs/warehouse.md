# Warehouse

Warehouse is responsible for storing wine either in the form of a cask or bottles.

## Pain Points

* Fine wine are stored in the form of cask and bottles.
* Casks are intended for investment purpose and must be kept in codition expected of the vintage.
* Casks investors demand data of condition.
* Fine wines are kept in condition slightly less than casks.
